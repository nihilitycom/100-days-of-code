### Day 0: May 27, 2024


**Today's Progress**: Learned git reset/revert,read some mind tricks addressing inner fears of coding.

**Thoughts:** I still cannot use git commands proficiently, and these commands are easily confused.But today I’m so lucky to read the article named Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark written by Alexander Kallaway which inspires me on the path of coding.

### Day 2:May 28, 2024


**Today's Progress**:Started study of Responsive Web Design, learned HTML by building a catphotoapp and completed 7-step study.

**Thoughts**: I found it interesting to make a website coz u will feel u r creating something and connected to web just through some code. That’s amazing. But just following courses on freecodecamp is a bit superficial. I still need to find some materials to learn more deeply and systematically.
