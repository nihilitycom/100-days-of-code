**Today's Progress**: learned git reset/revert,read some mind tricks addressing inner fears of coding.

**Thoughts:** I still cannot use git commands proficiently, and these commands are easily confused.But today I’m so lucky to read the article named Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark written by Alexander Kallaway which inspires me in the path of coding.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
