**Today's Progress**:Started study of Responsive Web Design, learned HTML by building a catphotoapp and completed 7-step study.

**Thoughts**: I found it interesting to make a website coz u will feel u r creating something and connected to web just through some code. That’s amazing. But just following courses on freecodecamp is a bit superficial. I still need to find some materials to learn more deeply and systematically.
